# enLIGHTen-LED-Clock

The enLIGHTen clock is an open-source project that will initially release as part of a kickstarter campaign and instructable in April of 2018.

This project leverages a ton of work from the McLighting Project although the code is heavily modified.   The clock is now stable but as with any web-connected device, the possibilities for enhancement are many. 

Here are a few features:  The clock syncs every minute with a timeserver ensuring that your time will always be perfect.  Set your timezone once, enable daylight savings mode and you won't ever need to worry about setting your clock again!

50 different animations with adjustable color, speed and brightness give the user precise control and infinite variation.  Favorite modes are saved in memory.  Light timers and daily events can be set which allow users to visually be notified at a selected time. 

Special holiday modes can add festivity to your house during Halloween, New Years or Christmas. We even have a special mode for pi day where the clock animates the digits of pi for 100 digits every hour.

The CNC source files are available on instructables.com as well as all the build instructions.
